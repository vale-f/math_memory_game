# math_memory_game
I completed 'CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python' on my own and developed a Math Memory Matching Game for my final project.
The final project required us to create two files: project.py (which included a main function and three or more additional functions) and test_project.py (with test functions).

This game is a simple way to combine math and memory skills. On one side, the player has math problems, and on the other side, they have the corresponding answers. The player’s task is to find and match each problem with its correct answer.
